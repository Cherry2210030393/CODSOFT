The atteched CODSOFT Program is done in jupyter notebook.
This program aims to predict the survival of Titanic people.(Where 0's are Not survived and 1's survived).
The program is done in python and for each every component of the code there will be a explaination.
At the last of the program i have developed a code that predicts the survival rate of the people qho have survived in the Titanic Ship. 

Also i have attached the Program(CODSOFT) and the DataSet with the name of archive.zip..
